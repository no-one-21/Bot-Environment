# Bot-Environment
This is a bot environment developed in C++ and Python for checkers. 

## Bot
We built a checkers bot in C++ which uses minimax search for move search and static evaluation as evaluation function. This bot plays the game of checkers. The bot vs bot mode can be tested by -
* Compile the main.cpp file with  (g++ main.cpp)
* Run the resulting output file a.out
* Press the Enter key to see next move

## GUI
We built the GUI in python (pygame). It uses the checkers bot as an example. It can be used to oraganize matches between any checkers bot following the defined protocols.
